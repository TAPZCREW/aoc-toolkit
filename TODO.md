- Handle problem test inputs and outputs (see [aocd-example-parser](https://github.com/wimglenn/aocd-example-parser))
- Use dependency injection for `AocService` and `httpx::AsyncClient`
- Lazy-load problem input
- Pass an async file-like argument to `parse_input` instead of the whole input as a `str`
- Fetch new problem description after submitting part 1 answer (as an optional flag)
- Add year, day and problem name as comments in generated `script.py`
